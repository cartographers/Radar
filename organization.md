# Data visualization 

### 1. Postico with D3 visuals

#### Recent pitch 
    - to have an app like postico with an additional feature - 
        - for clients to be able to visualize a query according to their needs - tabular format, charts, bar graphs, maps, and more....  
    - and to be able to make those queries like it was writing simple english.. helpful for non-programmers. 
#### Where would we get the client data from and where can clients create their new databases? 
    - Postgres â€¦ ok to use because its a part of the fullstack curriculum.       
#### How can clients add new fields to their databases? 
    - using database merging.. 
#### native d3 or reactd3? 
    - use reactD3 and redux for the app.. 
#### Features: 
    - have a login/signup page as the homepage
    - once logged in users get directed to a dashboard (list of databases a user is part of)
    - user chooses the database he would like to work on...that directs client to a new page : 
        - that shows the data visualizations associated with the tables in the database... 
        - clients can make queries.. and have a data visualziation  to go with it .. it should be intelligent enough 
        to know what to build .. 
        - queries can then have visualizations as well (client has power to see what type of D.V to see)
        ** clients can add rows to the tables (use database merging to make that happen)..
                - *** ability to add fields later on.. 
	    - be able to download the displayed visualizations in a .gif format or .jpg format.. 
	    - Series of intelligent dropdowns of tables
	    - Filter on operators 
	    - continuously streaming sequelize log information and tools for handling logs .. incorporate algorithmic 
	    approach to handling streaming data .. MACHINE LEARNING..  

### 2. Emotion Recognition Therapy (MatchMaker.js file?)
- Therapist gives 45 minute topic
- Not limited to therapy. Used in conversing with social interactions, dating?, interviews
- User discusses topic on video
- Can analyze emotional data, and displayed in real-time on screen
- Possible custom screen settings? (ie. Terminator red-text: happiness levels: 0.3, stressed: 0.8, fear: 0.9)
- Emotional data collected lets user know how well they "connected" to other user
- Improves self-awareness and social interacting skills
