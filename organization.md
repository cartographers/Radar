## Data visualization 

- dash board with multiple tables and adding data visualizations 
- have a 3 page app - dashboard, update existing tables, add new tables 
- add collaborators - (similar to graceshopper admins)
- how can we add new fields? what if the new field messes the existing database? what if it messes up the routes?
    - filter 
- do not manipulate the tables from the frontend but can add new rows! 
- user can add new information to existing databases
- line graphs, bar graphs, maps.. 
- be able to generate data visualizations based on table relationships. eg. what products are more ordered throughout
 the year, or specific days, etc.
