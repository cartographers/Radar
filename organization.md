## Data visualization 
- Postico with D3 visuals
	- dash board with multiple tables and adding data visualizations 
	- have a 3 page app - dashboard, update existing tables, add new tables 
	- add collaborators - (similar to graceshopper admins)
	- how can we add new fields? what if the new field messes the existing database? what if it messes up the routes?
	    - filter 
	- do not manipulate the tables from the frontend but can add new rows! 
	- user can add new information to existing databases
	- line graphs, bar graphs, maps.. 
	- be able to generate data visualizations based on table relationships. eg. what products are more ordered throughout
	 the year, or specific days, etc.
